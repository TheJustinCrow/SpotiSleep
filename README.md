SpotiSleep is a Spotify desktop sleep timer designed to simplify your music listening experience by providing a convenient way to set a timer for when Spotify should stop playing music.

## How It Works

SpotiSleep offers a user-friendly GUI, allowing you to select a specific duration until Spotify automatically stops. After the set time elapses, SpotiSleep halts the Spotify process, ensuring a seamless transition from your music to a peaceful silence.
